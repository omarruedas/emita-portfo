            <br>
            <p class="card-text" >It is the nurses responsibility to ensure the patient understands their plan of care. Integrating various disciplines in the patient's care assists the client in making an informed decision in their health. The nurse must assess the patient and integrate their knowledge, theories, and methods that they have learned throughout their nursing career. In Pharmacology, NURS- 2860 we wrote Drugs at the Bedside paper which helped me better understand the concept of informed decision making. The paper depicts a hypothetical patient and their health prognosis and the steps to safely administer medication to the patient. The nurse must critically think and view the patients health holistically when administering a medication. The paper discusses that it is the nurses responsibility to ensure that the patient understands why they are taking their medication. The nurse is also responsible in ensuring that the patient knows how to properly take their medication. </p>

            <br>
            <p class="card-text">The use of evidence based practice (EBP) ensures that the most up to date information is used while providing care for the patient. The patient's safety is the number one priority. The nurse must be knowledgeable in finding evidence based practice and utilizing the EBP during the patient's time of care. The use of the most current practice is vital in ensuring the best patient outcome. An assignment that assisted me to connect the use of EBP to promote quality care and patient safety was my Mental Health Case Study for NURS-3910. I used a plethora of peer-reviewed articles to find evidence for planned interventions for each nursing diagnosis. Many of the articles provided examples of how to approach a patient based off of their diagnosis. This assignment seamlessly connected the importance of the use of information literacy to promote quality and patient safety. </p>

When delegating, it is important to oversee the care that is being delivered. In the exit ticket assignment attached, different leadership styles are discussed. The different styles have pros and cons and most importantly, have an impact on the quality of care that is provided by the nurse and healthcare team.                                                                       </p>

Care plans were an important resource in planning our care and applying our leadership and decision making abilities. We were responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating the care that we provided for our patients. Attached is an example of a care plan that depicts clinical judgment and the use of evidence when caring for a client. Research documents were used to describe the patient's diagnosis. Medications and labs were thoroughly analyzed and discussed according to the patient's prognosis. Examples of interprofessional care would be working with the physical therapist and respiratory therapist to ensure they meet with the patient throughout their time of care. </p>

            <p class="card-text">At Valley Children's Hospital I had the opportunity to have a translator from the hospital come and meet with my patient so that I can speak to the mother in her native language. Attached is my experience at Valley Children's Hospital. Technology and information systems are used on a day-to-day basis at the hospital.  Some examples include the electronic health record, iPads for translating, and the use of IV Alaris pumps.  technology allows for us to perform safe nursing practice. In my final semester of nursing school, I used an iPad to translate to a patient who did not speak English. These sorts of Technologies are greatly appreciated in the nursing profession and promote patient safety. </p>

            <p class="card-text">In Community health, NURS- 4400, I wrote a Global Health paper on a lesser developed country. We identified in depth the country's background and health related information. We then identified health indicators and issues to create a plan on eradicating hunger and poverty for that country. Unfortunately, lesser developed countries such as Ethiopia, do not have access to a healthcare system nor do they have a strong regulating body that can fund to have a healthcare policy in place. With the use of evidence based practice and research articles I was able to understand the importance of healthcare policies and how it affects the individuals it regulates.  </p>

            <p class="card-text">It is important for nurses to collaborate with other nurses as well as individuals in the community to deliver patient centered care. Nurses can work in the community to help deliver care at schools and at homes to help prevent illnesses. In Community Health Clinical, NURS-4410, I created a teaching project which was a presentation for elementary students. We taught the importance of hand hygiene by using interactive methods with the students and sources from the schools district. I also used evidence-based practice to teach the most up to date information to the students. Attached is a quiz to ensure understanding and comprehension of the information presented. </p>

            <br>
            <p class="card-text">Patient centered care requires a holistic approach. There are many different values and practices that come along with different cultures. The nurse will need to assess what the patient's preferences are and include the preferences in the patient's plan of care. Understanding the various factors that make up a patient's attitudes and beliefs helps the nurse create realistic goals for the patient. The family assessment paper for Community Health Clinical, NURS-4410 was an in depth assignment primarily focusing on the patient and families environment, values, and attitudes. Gathering such information assisted in a diagnosis, goal, objective, intervention, and evaluation of the patient's care.  Understanding where the patient comes from and involving patient preferences allows for better patient-centered care. </p>

            <p class="card-text">In Nurse-2810, Professional Nursing, I wrote a paper on personal beliefs and ethics. The purpose of this assignment was to understand how our own beliefs influence the care we provide as nurses. I had the opportunity to examine my own beliefs and understand how my moral compass can affect the quality of care that I provide to a patient. In the paper, I present a personal professional framework and apply the framework to a clinical setting. I compare and contrast my core belief to an ethical concept. I then describe the importance of respecting the patient's morals and beliefs even if they are different than my own.  </p>

            <br>
            <p class="card-text">In my final semester of nursing school, I attended a virtual conference conducted by Johns Hopkins Medicine. The research conference was on continuum of care focusing on maternal, fetal, and neonatal medicine. Attending conferences as a nurse enhances our knowledge as nurses. With the profession of nursing, professional growth and development is a lifelong commitment. I have understood how attending conferences is an excellent way to enhance my knowledge especially in a speciality that I will be working in. Engaging with other individuals helps with the growth of our knowledge and learning the most up to date evidence based practice. For example, we can use this knowledge in our practice and create new policies for the hospital we work at. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Each patient has their own understanding of what health means to them. Some patients may seek acute care whereas others prefer comfort care depending on the patient's diagnosis. . There are many different ways to help treat a patient such as the use of pharmacology. Holistic care means that the nurse is tending to the patient's overall wellness rather than just treating the illness. The healthcare team can provide various types of complementary therapies to the patient. In Pediatrics Nursing, NURS-3800 we created a powerpoint presentation for parents of cancer children. The powerpoint includes complementary therapies catered towards children. For example, we included teaching on using aromatherapy. Different scents can assist with the side effects of cancer treatments. The use of complementary therapies implement a holistic approach when caring for various patient populations.  </p>
